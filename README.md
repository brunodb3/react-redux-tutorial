This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The intent of this project is to create a basic React App using Redux, to understand how it works.

## Useful links

I followed mainly one tutorial - [React Redux Tutorial for Begginers by Valentino Gagliardi](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-redux-tutorial-beginners/), but there's a few other useful links that helped with the creation of this project, listed below:

### Observations

There's some libraries in this project that are either deprecated or outdated. `react-router-redux` is one of them. I chose to use them for learning purposes. In the future, I will create more projects with different libraries.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run commit`

Creates a new commit using on Commitizen, to make standard commit messages. Works really well with standard-version (see below - `release` script).

For more information, check the [Commitizen repository](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

### `npm run release`

Creates a new release, bumping the project version and adding changes to `CHANGELOG.md`, according to commit messages.

For more information, check the [Standard Version repository](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
